# Crypto Clustering

## Background
In this challenge, I have assumed the role of an advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. I am proposing a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of relying solely on returns and volatility, my proposal includes additional factors that could impact the crypto market, potentially leading to better portfolio performance.

## How I prepared my analysis

1. Imported the Data
2. Prepared the Data
3. Found the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
4. Clustered Cryptocurrencies with K-means, using the Original Data
5. Optimised Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
6. Found the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
7. Clustered the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
8. Visualised and Compared the Results

### Dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries installed to run the code:
- Pandas
- hvPlot
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- holoviews
- bokeh

You can install these libraries using pip if they are not already installed.

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided and follow the step-by-step instructions.
3. Execute the code cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.

### Summary
This challenge involves clustering cryptocurrencies based on price change data and utilises techniques such as K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By the end of this project, you'll gain insights into the clustering patterns of cryptocurrencies, helping you understand their market behavior.
